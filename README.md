        <p> <strong>My-Book-Recommender-System</strong> is a Machine Learning based project. Two models have been implemented in this project
            namely :
            <ol>
                <li>Popularity based and</li>
                <li>Collaborative Filtering based recommender system.</li>
            </ol>
           <strong>Cosine Similarity</strong> has been used as a measure to identify similarity between two books based on the
           user ratings. Since the "pivot table" has may entries as null values, cosine similarity gives more appropriate
           result.
        </p>
        <p>
            The books which got more than 50 ratings and the users who have rated more than 200 books (experienced users) are taken into consideration during
           model building.
